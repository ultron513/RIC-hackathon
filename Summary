The project involves creating EduConnect, an online platform designed to enhance the experience of online learning by fostering collaboration, communication, and peer interaction. The platform features virtual study rooms, peer matchmaking, interactive discussion forums, social learning feeds, and tools for collaborative projects. It also integrates gamification, virtual office hours, and accessibility features to ensure an inclusive and engaging environment for students.

EduConnect is built on a robust tech stack that includes React.js and Node.js for frontend and backend development, with MongoDB for data storage and WebRTC for real-time communication. The platform is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS) and to scale according to the needs of educational institutions, ensuring a secure, user-friendly, and community-oriented online learning experience.
